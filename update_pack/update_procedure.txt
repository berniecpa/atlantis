Please follow the instructions carefully.

"N.B : BEFORE UPDATING TO THE LATEST VERSION, WE WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF YOU KEEP A BACKUP OF THE EXISTING VERSION."

PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE RUNNING THE 2.10 VERSION BEFORE UPDATING TO 2.11.
IF YOU ARE ALREADY RUNNING THE 2.11 VERSION THERE IS NO NEED TO UPDATE.

Let's proceed,
- Go to system settings from settings menu in admin panel
- Move to the section 'Update Product' on that page
- Upload the file 'update_2.11.zip' which is located at "update_pack" folder inside your copy of Atlas app downloaded from Codecanyon.
- Hit the button 'Update Product'.
- Now clear your browser cache to see the actual results.
	For Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
	For Mac: Command + Shift + R

- That's it

.....Thank You......
